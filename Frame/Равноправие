It is based on the 7 concepts submitted by us to IARPA in January 2014.
The other 6 are Freedom, Equality, Democratic_institutions, Representation_and_decision-making, Organization_of_power,

Equality comes down to all members of a group or society having access to the same resources, without some members being valued less than others (Plato: ‘Friends have all things in common.’). In an equal society, citizens receive equal treatment in the eyes of the law. The parameters according to which equality is determined may vary.
The venue in which citizens are treated equally are varied as well: they may have an equal right to vote (universal suffrage); equal right to opportunity (education, medical care).
Equality is linked to freedom. Equality yields freedom in all areas, so there is a causal relationship between recognition of equal status (in whatever domain) and freedom (to expression, to resources) in that domain, and in general.
