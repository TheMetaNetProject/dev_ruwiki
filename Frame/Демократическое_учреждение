Democratic institutions are numerous formal and informal conventional practices, laws, rules, and norms that are crucial for democratic laws and principles (along with the equality and freedom associated with democracy) to be practiced. Representation and decision-making are amongst the valued institutions of a recognized democracy, in addition to free economic institutions (including capitalism), political institutions, and social institutions.
The democratic institutions which are relevant to a comparative cross-linguistic and cross-cultural study of metaphors include: free speech/freedom of expression, freedom of the press, unions, elections, educational institutions, health and welfare institutions, property rights, assembly and political parties, judicial and legal institutions.
